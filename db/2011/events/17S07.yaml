    One major benefit of JRuby is the ability to import Java classes and then use them as if they were POROs (Plain Old Ruby Objects). This feature makes Java fun again. You can pull in legacy code and sculpt an API which fits nicely into your Ruby code. You can access novel or robust Java libraries to bridge a gap in existing Ruby libraries.
    
    This talk will:
    
        * Show basics of interacting with Java classes from within Ruby
        * Implementing Java interfaces with Ruby blocks and classes
        * Point out Gotchas
        * Give style hints to make Java APIs fit better into the Ruby way
    
    By the end of this talk you should be able to effectively consume Java libraries in Ruby in a way that is satisfying and useful.
